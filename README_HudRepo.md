Hello

This README will cover items in the HudRepo Repository

PropPy
  - A collection of propulsion and rocket engine design related codes, mainly used to aid design work for the UCI Rocket Project, as well as personal projects.
  - PropPy currently contains the CEAProcessing folder, which contains a script and supporting files that will automate the NASA CEA process.
  - More to come (: ðŸš€

*My repo is public and mainly serves as a file sharing method and portfolio.*
